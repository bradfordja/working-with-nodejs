NodeJs back-end code with Kafka api function

I want to help writing a sample code for the following use case; suppose we're building a Node e-commerce application and we want to integrate Kafka for real-time inventory updates. Whenever a product is sold, the inventory count decreases. We wish to notify different services (e.g., a re-stocking service, an analytics service) of these inventory changes in real-time.


To implement real-time inventory updates in a Node.js e-commerce application with Kafka for various services like re-stocking and analytics, you need to integrate Kafka producers and consumers within your Node.js application. This integration involves sending messages (inventory updates) to a Kafka topic whenever a product is sold and consuming those messages from the topic to notify relevant services.

### AWS System Requirements

1. **Amazon MSK (Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka)**: AWS's fully managed Apache Kafka service that makes it easy to build and run applications that use Apache Kafka to process streaming data.
2. **AWS Lambda**: To process inventory updates and notify services without provisioning or managing servers.
3. **Amazon DynamoDB**: To store inventory data.
4. **IAM Roles**: For Lambda functions to access other AWS services like MSK and DynamoDB.
5. **Amazon CloudWatch**: For monitoring and logging.

### Sample Use-Case Overview

- **Kafka Producer**: When a product is sold, the Node.js application publishes a message to a Kafka topic. The message includes the product ID and the new inventory count.
- **Kafka Consumer**: Services such as re-stocking or analytics subscribe to the Kafka topic. They consume messages and take appropriate actions, like reordering stock or updating analytics dashboards.
- **AWS Lambda**: Acts as consumers for Kafka messages to update DynamoDB or trigger other workflows.

### Implementation Steps

#### Step 1: Set up Amazon MSK

- Create an Amazon MSK cluster and note the broker details.
- Create a Kafka topic, e.g., `inventory_updates`.

#### Step 2: Integrate Kafka Producer in Node.js Application

1. **Install Kafka Node.js Client**

```bash
npm install kafkajs
```

#### Step 2. **Publish Inventory Update Messages**

```javascript
const { Kafka } = require('kafkajs');

// Initialize Kafka client with MSK broker details
const kafka = new Kafka({
  clientId: 'my-app',
  brokers: ['<MSK_BROKER_URL>'] // Replace with your MSK broker URLs
});

const producer = kafka.producer();

const publishInventoryUpdate = async (productId, count) => {
  await producer.connect();
  await producer.send({
    topic: 'inventory_updates',
    messages: [
      { value: JSON.stringify({ productId, count }) },
    ],
  });
  await producer.disconnect();
};
```

#### Step 3: AWS Lambda Kafka Consumer

1. **Create a Lambda function** that will act as a Kafka consumer. Use the `maven` archetype provided by AWS for Kafka triggers.

2. **Set up an IAM role** for Lambda with permissions to access MSK and DynamoDB.

3. **Lambda Function Code** (simplified for demonstration):

```javascript
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const dynamoDB = new AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient();

exports.handler = async (event) => {
  event.records['inventory_updates'].forEach(async (record) => {
    const { productId, count } = JSON.parse(Buffer.from(record.value, 'base64').toString());

    // Update DynamoDB, or notify services as needed
    const params = {
      TableName: 'ProductInventory',
      Key: { productId },
      UpdateExpression: 'set count = :count',
      ExpressionAttributeValues: {
        ':count': count,
      },
    };

    await dynamoDB.update(params).promise();
  });
};
```

4. **Configure the Lambda function** to be triggered by your MSK topic `inventory_updates`.

### Summary

This setup allows Node.js e-commerce application to publish inventory updates to a Kafka topic whenever a product is sold. AWS Lambda functions, acting as consumers, are triggered by these updates to perform tasks such as updating inventory counts in DynamoDB or notifying other services for actions like re-stocking or analytics. This architecture leverages AWS services for scalability, reliability, and maintenance efficiency while enabling real-time data processing and notifications across your application ecosystem.
